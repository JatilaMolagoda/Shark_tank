# Shark_tank
Using SharkTank dataset of USA/American business reality television series I run few SQL queries.
The data set has information from SharkTank season 1 to Shark Tank season 12.
The dataset has 40 fields/columns and 1000+ records.

Here are the questions

1. What is the total number of deals that have been made in all seasons of Shark Tank, and what is the average deal size in terms of investment amount per shark?
2. Which industry has the highest success rate in terms of getting a deal?
3. What is the success rate of pitches that have multiple entrepreneurs versus pitches with a single entrepreneur, 
and is there a significant difference in the investment amount per shark between the two categories?
4. How does the success rate of pitches vary by state, and which states have the highest and lowest success rates?
5. Which shark has invested the most in total across all seasons?
